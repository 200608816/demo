Question no 2
Write (and evaluate) python expressions that answer these questions:
a. How many letters are there in 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'?
b. Does 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' contain 'ice' as a substring?
The number of letters in 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' is: 34
Does 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' contain 'ice' as a substring? True
The longest word is: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
The first composer in the dictionary is: Bartok
The last composer in the dictionary is: Buxtehude

#a.

word = 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'
num_letters = len(word)
print(f"The number of letters in '{word}' is: {num_letters}")

# b. 

substring = 'ice'
contains_substring = substring in word
print(f"Does '{word}' contain '{substring}' as a substring? {contains_substring}")

# c. 

words = ['Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious', 'Honorificabilitudinitatibus', 'Bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonn']
longest_word = max(words, key=len)
print(f"The longest word is: {longest_word}")

# d.

composers = ['Berlioz', 'Borodin', 'Brian', 'Bartok', 'Bellini', 'Buxtehude', 'Bernstein']
first_composer = min(composers)
last_composer = max(composers)
print(f"The first composer in the dictionary is: {first_composer}")
print(f"The last composer in the dictionary is: {last_composer}")




OUTPUT

The number of letters in 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' is: 34
Does 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' contain 'ice' as a substring? True
The longest word is: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
